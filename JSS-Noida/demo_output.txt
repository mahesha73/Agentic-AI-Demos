for training automated code review systems. The paper highlights that the effectiveness of deep learning models heavily relies on the
quality and diversity of the data they are trained on. Limited or biased datasets can lead to suboptimal performance and
generalization issues.', 'model_interpretability': 'Another significant challenge outlined is the interpretability and explainability
of the deep learning models used in automated code review. Understanding how these models make decisions is crucial for developers to
trust and effectively utilize them in real-world scenarios. Lack of interpretability can hinder adoption and lead to skepticism.',
'integration_with_tools': 'The integration of automated code review systems with existing development tools poses a practical
challenge. Seamless integration with popular IDEs, version control systems, and continuous integration pipelines is essential for the
adoption of these systems in software development workflows. Incompatibility issues or complex integration processes can impede the
usability and effectiveness of the tools.', 'computational_requirements': 'The computational requirements for deploying deep learning
