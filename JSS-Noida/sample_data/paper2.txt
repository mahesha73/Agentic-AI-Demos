Authors: Dr. Alex Thompson, Maria Gonzalez, Prof. David Kim

Abstract:
This paper presents a novel approach to cybersecurity threat detection using quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum computing's parallel processing capabilities to improve the detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs) and zero-day exploits. Our experimental evaluation on a dataset of 50,000 network traffic samples demonstrates a 15% improvement in detection accuracy compared to classical machine learning approaches, while reducing false positive rates by 23%. The quantum enhancement is achieved through quantum feature mapping and variational quantum circuits optimized for pattern recognition in high-dimensional security data. We implement our approach using IBM's Qiskit framework and validate results on both quantum simulators and actual quantum hardware. The system achieves 94.7% accuracy in detecting previously unknown malware variants, significantly outperforming traditional signature-based detection methods. Our findings suggest that quantum computing can provide substantial advantages for real-time cybersecurity applications, particularly in scenarios requiring analysis of large-scale, high-dimensional data streams.

1. Introduction

Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve in sophistication and scale, presenting significant challenges for traditional detection systems. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) and zero-day exploits often evade conventional security measures through sophisticated evasion techniques.

Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for detecting novel threats by identifying patterns in network behavior and system activities. However, classical machine learning algorithms face limitations when processing high-dimensional security data in real-time.

Quantum computing offers unique advantages for machine learning tasks, including exponential speedup for certain algorithms and enhanced pattern recognition capabilities. This paper explores the application of quantum-enhanced machine learning to cybersecurity threat detection.

2. Related Work

Previous research in quantum machine learning has demonstrated theoretical advantages for classification and clustering tasks. However, practical applications to cybersecurity have been limited due to hardware constraints and algorithm development challenges.

Classical machine learning approaches to threat detection include support vector machines, random forests, and deep neural networks. While effective, these methods struggle with the high dimensionality and real-time requirements of modern cybersecurity applications.

3. Quantum-Enhanced Framework

Our proposed framework combines classical preprocessing with quantum feature mapping and classification. The system architecture consists of three main components:

3.1 Classical Preprocessing
Network traffic data is normalized and feature-extracted using traditional methods. This reduces noise and prepares data for quantum processing.

3.2 Quantum Feature Mapping
High-dimensional security features are mapped to quantum states using parameterized quantum circuits. This enables the exploitation of quantum superposition and entanglement for enhanced pattern recognition.

3.3 Variational Quantum Classifier
A variational quantum circuit performs classification using optimized parameters learned through hybrid quantum-classical training.

4. Experimental Setup

We evaluated our approach using a comprehensive dataset of network traffic samples, including both benign and malicious activities. The dataset contains 50,000 samples with 128 features each.

Experiments were conducted on IBM quantum simulators and actual quantum hardware (IBM Q System One). We compared our quantum-enhanced approach against classical baselines including SVM, Random Forest, and deep neural networks.

5. Results and Analysis

Our quantum-enhanced system achieved 94.7% accuracy in threat detection, representing a 15% improvement over the best classical baseline. False positive rates were reduced by 23%, significantly improving system usability.

Performance analysis reveals that quantum enhancement provides the greatest benefits for high-dimensional data with complex feature interactions. The quantum advantage becomes more pronounced as data dimensionality increases.

6. Implementation Challenges

Several challenges were encountered during implementation:
- Quantum hardware noise and decoherence effects
- Limited quantum circuit depth on current hardware
- Scalability constraints for large datasets
- Integration complexity with existing security infrastructure

7. Future Work

Future research directions include:
- Developing noise-resilient quantum algorithms
- Exploring quantum advantage for other security tasks
- Investigating hybrid quantum-classical architectures
- Scaling to larger, more diverse datasets

8. Conclusion

This work demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning for cybersecurity applications. While current quantum hardware limitations constrain practical deployment, our results suggest significant promise for future quantum-enabled security systems.

The 15% improvement in detection accuracy and 23% reduction in false positives represent meaningful advances for cybersecurity practitioners. As quantum hardware continues to improve, we expect even greater advantages for quantum-enhanced threat detection systems.
